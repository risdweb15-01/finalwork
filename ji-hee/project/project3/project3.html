    <p>In sociology, social interaction is a dynamic sequence of social actions between individuals or groups who modify their actions and reactions due to actions by their interaction partners. Social interactions can be differentiated into accidental, repeated, regular and regulated.</p>

            <p>A social interaction is a social exchange between two or more individuals. These interactions form the basis for social structure and therefore are a key object of basic social inquiry and analysis. Social interaction can be studied between groups of two, three or larger social groups.</p>

            <p>Social structures and cultures are founded upon social interactions. By interacting with one another, people design rules, institutions and systems within which they seek to live. Symbols are used to communicate the expectations of a given society to those new to it, either children or outsiders. Through this broad schema of social development, one sees how social interaction lies at its core.</p>
