      <h2>
AT MULTIVERSITÉS CRÉATIVES, CENTRE POMPIDOU, 2012 <br>
LUSTLAB IN COLLABORATION WITH PIEKE BERGMANS

</h2>
    
      
      <p>
       From 3 May to 6 August 2012, the Centre Pompidou presented 'Multiversités créatives', an exhibition devoted to industrial forecasting and to new territories and creative tools. The exhibition leads visitors along a path of experimentation, research and groundbreaking works in the fields of architecture, design, new technologies and social innovation.
        <br><br>

       The Res Sapiens is a network of everyday objects, which use the internet as an endless source of energy. When working together they form a super-organism; revealing a possible awareness by mentally interpreting online data and their direct environment. The two lamps presented in Centre Pomidou are part of this network. They produce bodily responses, they shine, move and react, also to eachother. Using the continuous stream of micro-conversations on twitter, they enact the binaries of emotion and rationality. LAMP014 senses feelings in the vicinity of Paris while LAMP015 detects worldwide opinions about current significant wikipedia topics.
        <br><br>

        The Res Sapiens project merges the digital world with the physical. It connects them seamlessly and treats both entities equally. Not only does the project ask us questions, it also poses questions to itself. Res Sapiens investigates new forms of communication between a man and machine and between machine and machine.
        <br><br>

        Currently Res Sapiens is on show at TransNatural Festival, unitl october 7th at NEMO, Amsterdam.
