       Together with Casey Reas (Processing) and Chandler McWilliams LUST developed the book and site Form+Code in Design, Art and Architecture, published by Princeton Architectural Press. The publication discusses the role of software in visual design, art, and architecture. It hopes to generate interest in creating visual and spatial form with software across diverse fields by focusing on the history, theory, and practice of software in the arts. 
        <br><br>

      The book is about one fourth text and three fourths images and is organized around two parallel narratives: one told through images and captions, and the other through essays with related diagrams and images. This allows the book to be read cover-to-cover or leisurely looked through as a source of inspiration. 
      <br><br>

      The first two chapters set the foundation for the rest of the book by discussing the history of the computer in the arts and how software is used to create form. The five themes of repetition, transformation, parameters, visualization, and simulation are deeply linked to code. Each of these sections begin with an essay to define the territory, continues with images and captions, and concludes with code examples. Form+Code is not a programming tutorial; its goal is to inspire though the discussion of themes and projects. Each chapter starts with a paragraph set in a specially designed typeface, that does not exist as a typeface, but is programmed. The code generates the form, and this form will be different with each combination of letters. The book is available at Amazon.
