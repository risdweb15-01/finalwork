       This first version of the atlas from the Institute for Future Cities is a visualisation system to expose many different types of data related to the urban environment of Glasgow. By splitting data into layers they can be isolated for inspection, or combined to reveal new stories and better understand the city and its inhabitants.

        <br><br>
      Cities are complex systems with emerging qualities that cannot be reduced to static representations. Given the dynamic nature of the atlas, it can grow over time, new maps and infographics can be added, and updated as new information becomes available.
        <br><br>
In addition to presenting geographic features and political boundaries, an atlas can feature geopolitical, social, religious, environmental and economic statistics, all presented in an appropriate visualisation technique, allowing it to become a tool for reference and interpretation.
        <br><br>
In the Megacities visualisation you can explore the megacities of the world. A megacity is usually defined as a metropolitan area with a total population in excess of ten million people.

INSTITUTE FOR FUTURE CITIES
      <br><br>
      The role of cities and their impact on our lives has never been more important. With more than half the world's population now living in cities, our research seeks to improve quality of human life in urban areas across the world and enable current and future cities to be understood in new ways. We do this through research, working with commercial organisations, local and national government.
