SYMPOSIUM AND EXHIBITION, 2005 <br>

       LSx is a two year research project by LUST at The Leeds School of Contemporary Art and Graphic Design at Leeds Metropolitan University. LSx focuses on the areas where urban planning, information and media technologies and graphic design overlap. It maps cultural and social development in Leeds to generate new systems of analysis, new data and information streams, and create organisational software for further research, recognising that there is no better source than the modern city with all its macro and micro layers of informational complexity. Each of the projects four phases will include a symposium for students, academics and professionals, comprised of lecture series, workshops and exhibitions, led by designers, artists, urban planners and cultural critics.
        <br><br>

       The first LSx symposium had as its main focus an exhibition of contemporary work related to the themes of the symposium under the title Look Right (Look Left). This showcased contemporary works from 12 prominent designers, typographers, urban planners and artists to show the breadth of work in the merging fields of architectural and information processes and graphic design. It was not meant as a defining overview but rather as a tip-of-the-iceberg glimpse at some of what is possible.
