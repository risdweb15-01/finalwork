      <h1>IABR-: IABR−2014−CATALOGUE</h1>

      <h2>
URBAN BY NATURE−, 2013 - 2014<br>
IABR, ROTTERDAM

      The 6th IABR-, IABR–2014–URBAN BY NATURE–, curated by landscape architect Dirk Sijmons, claims that we can only resolve the world’s environmental problems if we solve the problems of the city. Looking through the lens of landscape architecture, IABR–2014– redefines the way we deal with urban challenges by analyzing the relationship between urban society and nature, and between city and landscape. This 6th edition of the biennale argues that, perhaps now more than ever, the city is an integral part of one huge urban landscape, a complex system that has become our natural environment. This point of departure has many implications for the way we plan and design our urban environment and it opens up possibilities to develop spatial interventions that make use of its metabolism. Applying new strategies that effectively address the city as the larger urban landscape that it is, we can make the city more resilient and thus truly contribute to a more sustainable future world.
        <br><br>
The catalog of the 6th International Architecture Biennale Rotterdam contains a detailed description of the main exhibition URBAN BY NATURE– and of all of the projects that are part of it. The curator, Dirk Sijmons, contributes an introduction to the theme and introduces the different sections of the exhibition. The work process and results of the three IABR–Project Ateliers are highlighted. The catalog also contains information on all of the conferences, lectures and other activities that take place under the umbrella of IABR−2014−.
        <br><br>

During the design process, we considered the catalog to be both an architectural and a spatial volume. The title is exposed on the sides of the book and functions, at the same time, as a tab system to indicate the different chapters in the catalog. In a way the edges now represent the different strata of the ‘’International Architecture Biennale Rotterdam’’. The title on the edges exists out of 272 borders that were printed on each spread throughout the whole catalog. Those borders got stacked and exposed the title when the catalogue was bound. Using a calculation principle a little program was devised that generated the 272 borders as individual pdf’s. A typographical column system separates the different levels of information.
