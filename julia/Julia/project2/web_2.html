       How have women's political rights changed around the globe to get to this International Women's Day? This interactive map shows the long history of the fight for suffrage and political representation around the globe. Click and drag on the year slider to see the changing face of women's political representation over the years. Clicking on a country shows more detailed information, as statistics on birth control, employment figures and how many women are in ministerial positions.

       The project got quite some media attention. It appeared on the homepage of The Guardian, Got 15k Facebook likes over 2 days, Der Zeit added it to their link tips, Stanford University and The Washinton Post wrote and tweeted about it, Fast.Co Exist covered it extensively, as well as many Women Organizations mentioned the project in thousands of tweets. 
        <br><br>

        From the article on the Washington Post:
        <br><br>

        "A new map designed by the Dutch firm LUSTlab for World Women’s Day illustrates exactly how far women’s rights have come in recent years — and how far, in some places, they still have to go.<br><br>

        The interactive map shows when women got the right to vote and to stand for election in every country but the disputed Western Sahara. It also tracks issues like childbirth deaths, laws against domestic violence, and the percentage of women in government.
        <br><br>

        Perhaps unsurprisingly, Saudi Arabia comes out at the bottom on almost every metric. The conservative Muslim kingdom is still the only place where women can neither vote nor stand for election — to say nothing of driving, or traveling without male permission – and laws there do not protect women against domestic violence or marital rape.
        <br><br>

        Notably, King Abdullah has promised that women will vote in 2015 municipal elections, and he announced in January that women would soon fill 20 percent of the seats on his advisory Shura Council. But the council does not enact legislation, and women still face profound cultural inequities. In many parts of Saudi Arabia, restaurants, shopping malls and university classrooms all strictly segregate women from men."
         <br><br>

         From the article on Fast.Co Exist:
        <br><br>

        "People around the world celebrated International Women’s Day with symbolic gestures--like a song from female singers around the world, released by the UN, or an AirFrance flight piloted by an all-female crew--meant to honor the significant progress the global community has made on women’s rights (and address the many, many challenges that are still left)."
         <br><br>

         "...The data included is a potent reminder of some of the disparities in equality for women from one country to the next. But it’s also a great visualization of some oft-forgotten facts about the history of women’s rights.
          <br><br>

          Some favorite tidbits on this march to progress include the following: Finland was the first country where voters elected a woman to any office, in 1907, and New Zealand was the first country where women earned the right to vote, in 1893. But oddly enough, it was the United States where women were technically allowed to run for office--as early as 1788--even though no women were elected for anything until 1917 and women didn’t get to vote themselves until 1920.
           <br><br>

           Despite the U.S.’s long history of letting women run for office, our current congress is only 17% female, trailing behind many other countries including, South Africa (43%), Argentina (38%), Canada (25%), Mexico (25%), China (21%), France (20%), and The Dominican Republic (19%).
           <br><br>

           Saudi Arabia remains the only country where women can’t vote or run for office (although a female was appointed to office in 2009). North Korea is the only country (of the ones the project could find data for) where a woman has never been elected to office."
