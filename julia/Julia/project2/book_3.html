      <h1>MONDRIAAN ANNUAL REPORT 2004</h1>

      <h2>
BOOK, 2004 - 2005<br>
MONDRIAAN FOUNDATION

      <p>
      The Mondriaan Foundation was created to stimulate visual arts, design and the cultural heritage of the Netherlands. It's task is to strengthen the international position of contemporary visual arts and design by offering financial support to enable institutions, companies and authorities -both national and international- to reach their audience.
        <br><br>

        The Annual Report gives information about all the projects they (co-)financed, totalling more than thousand projects which were supported for as little as a hundred and to as much as millions of Euros. A typographical system which separates different levels of information as a thread forms the lay-out of the pages, and divided by 3-ring pie chart that graphs exactly what they spend on each project. Every page is printed on a different color paper, in a random order which is unique to each copy of the report. There are 8 different colors for the cover and more than 20 different colors for the inside.
