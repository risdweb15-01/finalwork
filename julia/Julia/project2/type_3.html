      <h1>VOLHARDING 1996, 1998, 1999</h1>

FACADE TYPOGRAPHY, 1996 - 1999 <br>
WILS&CO

      <p>
       This building was built in the early 20’s and was once the headquarters of the social cooperative De Volharding. The architect, Jan Buijs, designed the building with built-in illuminated signs on two facades.
        <br><br>

      After a brief period of service, the signs were never used again after the 20’s. In 1996, Wils&Co -the architectural platform in The Hague- received permission to light up the signs on one side of the building to commemorate the opening of the National Week of Architecture. The design had to be of this time yet respecting the period in which the building was made. Since the initial use, we have continued to change the design each year for each new Week of Architecture. Starting in 1996 with quotes from architects, to the more poetic treatment of the surface of the building in 1999 (poem from the Dutch poet Lucebert). The design evolved in conjunction, from the ‘no-curves’ typeface Citizen from Suzanna Licko, to LUST typefaces made out of bitmaps (applying screen-based typography to the matrix of the building).
