      <h2>SHARED VOICES</h2><p>The RISD Presidential Speaker Series offers a forum for welcoming some of the most expansive thinkers of our times to campus. Each speaker is a master of his or her domain but is also ready to transcend it, sharing the RISD communityâ€™s own belief in the fruitful exchange of ideas that happens when artists, designers, activists, scientists and other scholars really talk and listen to each other.</p>

      "Designers today stand on the brink of being seen by society as essential contributors to its health, safety, and welfare. If you -together with the other design professions- decide to examine the materials and processes endemic to your work, as well as demand that these materials and processes become environmentally safe, you will be the heroes of the 21st Century." <br><span class="people">Susan S. Szenasy</span>

      "Designers have enourmous power to influence how we see our world, and how we live our lives." <br><span class="people">David Berman</span>
      <br></br>
      "Designers actually have more potential to slow environmental degradation than economists, politicans, and environmentalist. Their power is catalytic." <br><span class="people">Alastair Foud-Luke</span>
