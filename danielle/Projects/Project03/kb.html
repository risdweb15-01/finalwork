	<h2>Kathryn Bigelow</h2>
        <div class="scroll">
	<p>Bigelow's subsequent trilogy of action films — Blue Steel, Point Break, and Strange Days — merged her philosophically minded manipulation of pace with the market demands of mainstream film-making. In the process, Bigelow became recognizable as both a Hollywood brand and an auteur. All three films rethink the conventions of action cinema while exploring gendered and racial politics. She became the first woman to receive an Academy Award for Best Director for The Hurt Locker.She was the fourth woman in history to be nominated for the honor, and only the second American woman.</p>
	<p style="font-family:Cabin Sketch;">"If there's specific resistance to women making movies, I just choose to ignore that as an obstacle for two reasons: I can't change my gender, and I refuse to stop making movies. It's irrelevant who or what directed a movie, the important thing is that you either respond to it or you don't. There should be more women directing; I think there's just not the awareness that it's really possible. It is.  ”</p>
