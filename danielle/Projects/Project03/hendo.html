	<h2>Jill & Greg Henderson</h2>
        <div class="scroll">
	<p>For the past 20 years, architect Greg Henderson has been trying to figure out ways of building safer buildings to withstand earthquakes. Along the way, he came up with a method using electromagnetic fields to separate the building from the ground during an earthquake. But he also realized the technology could be used in plenty of other ways, especially in the field of transportation where similar yet less efficient technology is used in bullet trains called Maglev. But first, Henderson needed to start small and get some way to capture people’s imagination. That’s where the Hendo hoverboard comes in.</p>
	<p style="font-family:Cabin Sketch;">“I’m an architect, not a scientist,” said Henderson. “The idea came from being able to levitate buildings out of earthquakes. All of the patents I was looking at were for moving objects. So I asked, why is that? If I can levitate a train, why not a house? We want to use the Hendo hoverboard and hover engines as a way to capture attention and bring attention to an important topic. Our responsibility is to help figure out a better way to build.”</p>
