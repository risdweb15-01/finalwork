                            James Biber has practiced architecture in a 
                            multi-disciplinary environment for more than 25 years. 
                            Trained first as a biologist, then as an architect, James has
                            surrounded himself with a variety of thinkers from different
                            fields to expand the notion of architecture. His work 
                            centers on a belief that architecture as an expression of 
                            identity is inseparable from its language of form and 
                            tectonics. The result is an architecture tied closely to its 
                            context; whether physical, cultural or metaphorical.
                            The US Pavillion design will be leaded by Biber Architects
                            in collaboration with RISD students.
                            The concept of this exposition pavillion will be an open 
                            space that will revisit the lines of a traditional American barn.

                           Richard Meier received his architectural training at 
                            Cornell University and established his own office in 
                            New York City in 1963. He has received the highest honors 
                            in the field including the Pritzker Prize for Architecture, 
                            the Gold Medals of the American Institute of Architects 
                            and the Royal Institute of British Architects as well as the 
                            Praemium Imperiale from the Japan Art Association.
                            The principles that guide HIS work are rooted in timeless, 
                            classical design issues such as Site, Order, and the use of 
                            Natural Light that are not unique to period, style, or 
                            context. Modern architecture provides us with an 
                            optimistic view of contemporary life, while 
                            complementing its context with the exploration of other 
                            essential values that are of our time: Program, 
                            Technology, Sustainability, Collaboration, and Image.
