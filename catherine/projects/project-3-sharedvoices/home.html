       <div class="description"><p>SHARED VOICES The RISD Presidential Speaker Series offers a forum for welcoming some of the most expansive thinkers of our times to campus. Each speaker is a master of his or her domain but is also ready to transcend it, sharing the RISD community’s own belief in the fruitful exchange of ideas that happens when artists, designers, activists, scientists and other scholars really talk and listen to each other.<br><br><br></p></div>

       <div id="main-text"><p>

                  Watson has come a long way since Hogwarts. She’s finding her niche as an actor, appearing in films like "The Bling Ring" and "Noah." Last summer, Watson was named UN Women Goodwill Ambassador. Her speech before the UN on behalf of the HeForShe campaign went viral and established the 24 year old as an important advocate for gender equality. Somehow, she also found time to graduate from Brown University.</p>
