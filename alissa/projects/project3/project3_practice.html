                 <div class="intro-1">This year’s RISD GOOD DESIGN Speaker Series will introduce three product designers who left a significant footprint in the design world of the 21st century. Product designes, Dieter Rams, Jonathan Ive, and Naoto Fukasawa are three incredible visionaries who have become famous for their simple and thoughtful designs. They hav become great exemplars of what defines product design today, and have influenced and inspired one another in their works for the past decade. Rams’ 10 principles of Good Design have played a large role inspiring these three designers in their design process, and will be most likely be a main topic to be explore as these three designers present their experiences, process, etc. to the RISD community beginning February 14th. 
                RISD welcomes you all to join these three speakers in what will be a very important and meaningful night to all those who aspire to become great designers and visionaries.</div>
