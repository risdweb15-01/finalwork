Product designes, Dieter Rams, Jonathan Ive, and Naoto Fukasawa are three incredible vi- sionaries who have become famous for their simple and thoughtful designs. They hav become great exemplars of what defines product design today, and have influenced and inspired one an- other in their works for the past decade. Rams’ 10 principles of Good Design have played a large role inspiring these three designers in their design pro- cess, and will be most likely be a main topic to be explore as these three designers present their ex- periences, process, etc. to the RISD community beginning February 14th.
                            RISD welcomes you all to join these three speakers in what will be a very important and meaningful night to all those who aspire to become great de- signers and visionaries.</p></div>
