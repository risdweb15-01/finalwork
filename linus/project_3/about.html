    <h3><span><font color="white"> SHARED VOICES </font></span><br></br> The RISD Presidential Speaker Series offers a forum for welcoming some of the most expansive thinkers of our times to campus. Each speaker is a master of his or her domain but is also ready to transcend it, sharing the RISD communityâ€™s own belief in the fruitful exchange of ideas that happens when artists, designers, activists, scientists and other scholars really talk and listen to each other.

    <h3> 
          In this lecture series, we have 
        invited three established innovators in the food industry.  The three speakers: <span><font color="lightpink"> Jamie Oliver </font></span>, a British celebrity chef who is now also heading a global campaign for better food education; <span><font color="lightgreen">David Chang</font></span>, founder of the highly popular and innovative restaurant chain Momofuku that is now taking over the culinary world by storm with his creative yet daring dishes; and finally <span><font color="lightblue">Ethan Brown</font></span>, founder of Beyond Meat, whose mission is to create meat alternative with plant protein in an attempt to improve human health and the negative impacts of the meat industry on the 
        environment. Coming from three different but tightly related backgrounds, the three speakers will offer us their unique perspectives on the very basic but complex subject of food.
